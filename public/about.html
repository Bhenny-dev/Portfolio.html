<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I am Bhenny Benlor D. Rivera, born at Mount Data Cliff, Monamon Sur Bauko Mountain Province, CAR, and currently living in Pico, La Trinidad, Benguet. I am a second-year college student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology at The
    King's College of the Philippines. My academic journey is fueled by my passion for technology, digital design, and music. I possess a diverse set of skills, including proficiency in digital design and multimedia, guitar playing and music composition,
    as well as a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. I am also familiar with web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>My extracurricular activities include being an active member of the Music Club at my college, where I have participated in various campus events and performances, and collaborated with fellow musicians to create original compositions. Additionally, I
    am a digital design enthusiast, having created digital artworks and graphics for personal projects, and contributing to online design communities. With a background rooted in the rich cultural heritage of an Ilocano and Igorot family, I am deeply
    connected to my community and its traditions.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the guitar, creating music, exploring new technologies, and engaging in cultural activities. I am eager to apply my skills and passion to contribute to innovative projects and gain valuable experience in the field of information
    technology. My goal is to continuously learn and grow, both personally and professionally, while making a positive impact in the world of IT.</p>
